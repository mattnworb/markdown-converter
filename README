Converts a subset of markdown into the confluence wiki markup.

Forked from https://github.com/dirkk0/Markdown-Converter

Updated by Matt Brown:
* Print converted text to standard output rather than storing in a file (so it can be piped to other programs like pbcopy)
* Supported nested lists that are nested with spaces instead of tabs (for editors that use four spaces to represent a tab rather than a tab character)
